This is a responsive, and animated CSS Only Go Board!
Go is an ancient board game that originated in China 🐉 over 2500 years ago, and is one of the oldest known board games still played today.
I found the game interesting enough for me to replicate it in CSS.
Once the animation is done, play your move and capture the white stones by finishing the ladder!
