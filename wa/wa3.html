    <section id="production">
        <h2>Production</h2>
        <p>The film's troubled production, including mechanical shark malfunctions, led Spielberg to shoot many scenes without showing the shark, increasing suspense. The filmâ€™s iconic music was composed by John Williams.
            <ul>
                <li><em>Budget:</em> The film went over budget, with the effects budget alone growing to $3 million </li>
                <li><em>Rough sea conditions:</em> The film was shot in the ocean, which made it difficult to maintain steady shots</li>
                <li><em>Mechanical sharks:</em> The mechanical sharks were temperamental and would stop working frequently</li>
                <li><em>Bad weather:</em> Heavy rain and winds damaged camera equipment and sank boats</li>
                <li><em>Long days:</em>Long days: Long 12 hour days resulted in only 4 hours of actual filming</li>
                <li><em>Crew morale:</em> Crew members started calling the film "Flaws"</li>
                <li><em>Script:</em>The script was still being written as scenes were filmed</li>
                <li><em>Casting: </em>It was difficult to find actors for the roles of Quint and Hooper</li>

        <h2>Legacy & Impact</h2>
        <p>Jaws became the first-ever summer blockbuster, revolutionizing Hollywood's approach to movie releases. It grossed over $470 million worldwide and spawned multiple sequels. "Jaws" left a significant legacy by not only revolutionizing the summer blockbuster movie genre but also profoundly impacting public perception of sharks, creating a widespread fear of these creatures due to its portrayal of a man-eating great white, despite the film's fictional nature, leading to a decline in shark populations and a surge in shark research and conservation efforts aimed at correcting this misconception; essentially, "Jaws" is considered a cultural phenomenon that continues to influence how people view sharks today, even while raising awareness about their importance in the ecosystem</p>
