    <p> Hello ! my name is <strong> Caroline Kenney</strong>, and I use she/her pronouns. 
        I am a senior at CU Boulder, and I am studying Marketing, with a minor in Creative Technology and Design,
        and my goal for this course is to understand how to design websites, so that I am a stronger candidate for 
        marketing jobs I am applying for. I love skiing, country music, my friends and family, yoga, and sushi.
