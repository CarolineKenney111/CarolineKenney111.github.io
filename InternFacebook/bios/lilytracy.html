    <h2>Lily Tracy</h2>
    <p><strong>School:</strong> Skidmore College</p>
    <p>
      I’m Lily Tracy, a student at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, NY where I’m majoring in Management and Business and minoring in Political Science and Entrepreneurship. I grew up in Longmeadow, MA and recently spent a semester abroad in Milan, Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of the classroom, I’m a member of the Skidmore Women’s Lacrosse team and the campus president of Morgan’s Message, a mental health advocacy group for student-athletes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to spend my free time reading, learning to cook, and going to concerts with friends and family! I am super excited to live in Boston and explore the city. I’m looking forward to learning from the RxSense team and growing my skills with this group. Go Celtics!
