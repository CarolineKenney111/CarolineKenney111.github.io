    <h2>Aidan Swartz</h2>
    <p><strong>School:</strong> University of Minnesota</p>
    <p>
      Hi, I’m Aidan Swartz, a student at the University of Minnesota majoring in Economics with a focus in business. This past semester, I had the opportunity to study abroad in Barcelona, and the previous summer, I interned in London—both experiences that broadened my perspective and deepened my interest in business.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve never been to Boston before, so I’m really looking forward to exploring the city, especially trying new restaurants and checking out the local spots. In my free time, I enjoy playing golf, card games, and spending time with friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m excited and grateful to get started at RxSense and learn more about the company.
