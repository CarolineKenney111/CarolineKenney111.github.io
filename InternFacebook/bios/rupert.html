    <h2>Rupert Ramsay</h2>
    <p><strong>School:</strong> Hobart and William Smith Colleges</p>
    <p>
      My name is Rupert Ramsay, and I'm from Deerfield, Massachusetts. I attend Hobart and William Smith Colleges (HWS), where I'm double majoring in International Relations and Asian Studies, with a minor in English.
    </p>
    <p>
      I currently serve as a captain of the HWS Division III Swimming and Diving Team, an International Relations Teaching Fellow, a Head O'Laughlin Ambassador in the Office of Admissions, and I was recently elected to be a Student Trustee. Next year, I’ll begin training under the senior student trustees, and as a senior, I’ll serve as a voting member of the HWS Board of Trustees.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been studying Mandarin Chinese since kindergarten, and I hope to one day leverage my language skills and academic background to pursue a career in either national security or international business.
    </p>
    <p>
      This year, I had the opportunity to take both an introductory economics course and a class on international trade, which sparked a strong interest in the field of economics. Through this internship, I'm excited to further explore that interest and gain more hands-on experience.
