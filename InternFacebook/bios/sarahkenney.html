    <h2>Sarah Kenney</h2>
    <p><strong>School:</strong> Trinity College</p>
    <p>
      I study at Trinity College majoring in Psychology, and minoring in Rhetoric, Writing & Media Studies. I thrive on staying busy – balancing academics, athletics, and everything in between. Being part of the Trinity Women’s Varsity Soccer team has taught me more than just how to compete; it’s helped me strengthen my leadership skills, manage time efficiently, and stay grounded under pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      This year, I was inducted into Trinity’s chapter of Chi Alpha Sigma, the National Scholar-Athlete Society, and I’ve consistently made faculty honors while playing a sport I love.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Spring of 2024, I was honored to represent my peers as the sole female athlete speaking at the dedication ceremony for our new athletic facilities – a moment that meant a lot to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of class and soccer, I enjoy staying active through running, yoga, and skiing, but I also love slowing down and spending time with my friends, or exploring new places. Whether I’m on the field or in the classroom, I care deeply about giving my best effort and living my life with integrity.
