    <h2>Cole Tremaglio</h2>
    <p><strong>School:</strong> Union College</p>
    <p>
      Hello, my name is Cole Tremaglio. I was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and have lived just outside the city in Newton my whole life. I am a student at Union College in Schenectady, NY. I study Neuroscience with a focus on Cognitive Science.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also work with one of my professors in a research lab at Union College studying cognitive science through a learning experiment. I am currently studying in Florence, Italy, focusing on language, arts, and culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer and volleyball as well as alpine skiing. I also enjoy cooking at home or at school when I have the time.
