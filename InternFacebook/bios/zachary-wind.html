    <h2>Zachery Wind</h2>
    <p><strong>School:</strong> Dordt University</p>
    <p>
      My name is Zachery Wind, and I was born and raised in Colorado. Growing up on a dairy farm taught me the value of hard work from a young age, which continues to shape who I am today. I like to stay active, participating in basketball, golf, and track and field teams that have helped build my competitive spirit and teamwork skills. I am currently a student-athlete at Dordt University, where I am majoring in Business Marketing and competing as a member of the Track and Field team. In addition to athletics, I am an active member of the Dordt University Business Club, where I collaborate with campus food businesses to raise funds for strategic business trips. These trips have allowed me to explore cool industries and see real-world applications of business and marketing.

    <p>
      Beyond academics and athletics, I have an appreciation for community and connection. I enjoy meeting new people, forming meaningful relationships, and having fun with whoever I'm around. Whether I'm working with classmates, training with teammates, or catching up with friends and family, I try to bring energy, respect, and a sense of belonging to every conversation. In my free time, I love staying active, exploring new places, and creating memories with my friends while also balancing time to relax.
