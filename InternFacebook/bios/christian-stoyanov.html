    <h2>Christian Stoyanov</h2>
    <p><strong>School:</strong> University of Toronto</p>
    <p>
      My name is Christian Stoyanov. I am a Digital Enterprise major at the University of Toronto. I am originally from Boston, Massachusetts—more specifically, a small town called Cohasset, which is right by Cape Cod on the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was a competitive swimmer up to my senior year of high school, training up to seven days a week and traveling the country on weekends for competitions. In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis during the summers and skiing in the winters.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am thrilled this is my first official internship. In previous summers, I worked in food service shucking oysters and prepping lobster, as well as managing my own landscaping company. I am fully Bulgarian—both my mother’s and father’s families are from there—and I make sure to visit them every summer!
