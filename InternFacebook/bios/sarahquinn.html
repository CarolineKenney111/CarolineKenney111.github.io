    <h2>Sarah Quinn</h2>
    <p><strong>School:</strong> George Washington University</p>
    <p>
      I am from Seabrook Island, SC, and I’m currently pursuing a B.A. in International Business and International Affairs concentrating in Europe and Eurasia at George Washington University. As part of the Capital City Scholars Program, I had the opportunity to complete my first year of studies in Paris, France and will continue my global education this fall in Singapore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to this internship, I was fortunate to gain leadership and teamwork experience through Bicycles for Humanity - Charleston, leading efforts to collect and fundraise over a period of 5 years. In addition to serving as a board member, with the help of my generous community, I raised over $42,000, shipped 2,500+ bikes, and 1,000+ shoes to communities in Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am passionate about international travel, motorsport, food, arts, and conservation – a dedication resulting from 11 years of volunteering with Seabrook Island’s Turtle Patrol. Always eager to learn, I welcome new challenges and opportunities for growth.
