    <h2>Christian Gregory</h2>
    <p><strong>School:</strong> Colby College</p>
    <p>
      My name is Christian Gregory, and I’m a student at Colby College majoring in Economics with a concentration in Financial Markets and minoring in Philosophy. At Colby, I’m a member of the football team and actively involved in the Colby Student Investment Association, the Ice Fishing Club, and the Dostoevsky Book Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy watching philosophy and history videos on YouTube, spending time outdoors hiking and fishing. I also taught myself how to knit last winter, and I run a book club with friends from home.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m an avid listener of classical music, particularly composers like Rachmaninoff, Chopin, Shostakovich, and Lili Boulanger. This summer, I hope to continue practicing Judo or Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, something I started with friends last year and plan to pursue after college.
