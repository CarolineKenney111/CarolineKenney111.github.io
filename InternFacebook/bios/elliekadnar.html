    <p>
      Hi, my name is Ellie Kadnar, and I study at Elon University, majoring in Marketing with a minor in Finance. I am from Winchester, Massachusetts, where I spent my high school years prioritizing community involvement and pursuing my passion for service. At Elon, I am studying in the Martha and Spencer Love School of Business, where I have taken a variety of classes that have sparked my interest in marketing and business. Some of my favorite classes so far have been Principles of Marketing and Gateway to Business, where I’ve been able to apply real-world concepts and develop my skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, I am a member of Pi Sigma Epsilon, a professional fraternity focused on sales, marketing, and management.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am excited to intern with RxSense this summer and learn more about its innovative approach to healthcare solutions. I look forward to exploring different areas of the company, as I believe this experience will help me grow my business and marketing skills while gaining valuable insights into the healthcare industry.
