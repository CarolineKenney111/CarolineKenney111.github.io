    <h2>Finnegan Grob</h2>
    <p><strong>School:</strong> University of Arkansas</p>
    <p>
      My name is Finnegan Grob. I’m originally from Wisconsin and currently live in the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex. I study at the University of Arkansas, majoring in Finance with a minor in Innovation and Entrepreneurship. I just completed my semester abroad in Rome, Italy. During this time I had the opportunity to travel to 12 different countries. Through these experiences I gained exposure to cultures and perspectives that have expanded my worldview.
    </p>
    <p>
      This summer, I’m excited to expand my professional network and fully immerse myself in this unique opportunity, learning as much as I can each day. I look forward to applying my skills in a workplace environment and collaborating with others.
    </p>
    <p>
      My passions include weightlifting, snowboarding, and spending time in nature. A personal goal this year for me is to run a marathon.
