    <h2>Sara Gibson</h2>
    <p><strong>School:</strong> University of Tampa</p>
    <p>
      Born and raised in a big, loud, and loving Italian family in New Jersey, I’ve always craved connection—and a little adventure. That’s what led me to The University of Tampa for college. Growing up as a server, I discovered early on that I loved talking to people and building relationships. While working hard, reading people, and navigating high-pressure situations, I knew I needed a career that offered greater fulfillment and facilitated personal growth. As such, I decided to major in Marketing and take a class that concentrated in Sales. I realized I thrived off challenge and rejection, always chasing the next opportunity to grow and improve.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started my career at NetWolves Telecommunications. I found a passion not just for sales, but for how business and technology come together to solve problems. I was able to create five new business opportunities and closed two deals for NetWolves. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Next year, I’ll serve as Vice President of Sigma Phi Epsilon, the University of Tampa’s first sales fraternity, and participate in the advanced selling class. Coming to Boston is another exciting step outside my comfort zone—an opportunity to immerse myself in a new environment, embrace fresh experiences, and continue growing both personally and professionally.
