    <h2>Nate Mills</h2>
    <p><strong>School:</strong> University of Rochester</p>
    <p>
      My name is Nate Mills, and I study at the University of Rochester, double majoring in Political Science and Psychology. I’m passionate about understanding people—how they think, decide, and lead—which is why I’m planning to pursue people-focused business roles in consulting, sales, or marketing after graduation next May.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of academics, I serve as a student assistant coach for the U of R Football team, work as a research assistant in the political science department, and help lead the Catholic Athlete Society. I love competition, whether it's on the golf course, in a pickup basketball game, or during a heated round of trivia with friends.
